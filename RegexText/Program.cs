With a wingspan of up to 7ft, these birds of prey are a truly impressive sight. Here we can see one of the birds over Compartment 14, one of Mere's compartments from the 2020 planting season. This is a very positive sign, as regular sightings of the birds over this area indicate an abundance of prey.\r\n\r\nIt is truly rewarding to see the regeneration of the ecosystem, from imposing birds of prey to rare and colourful butterflies.

Ita€™s an advert for your product (your company). Ita€™s your one chance in a competitive hiring marketplace to segment, target and attract a candidate dripping in value, agility and bring diversity to your business.\r\n\r\nYou get one chance to make a great first impression.\r\n\r\nSo think. Can you name any other situations in which youa€™d exclude a bespoke marketing solution? No. Furthermore - would Sainsbury's ask their HR or TA function to create their next TV advert campaign? Did the TA create the Super Bowl half-time ads?\r\n\r\nSo why, as a staffing provider, are you letting the sales team create and publish the most important and integral piece of content - your job adverts? Why outsource and pay big retainers to RPOs who will simply copy and paste without embracing data, science or AI?

We never compromise either of these principles.\\r\r\n\\r\r\nWe also work hard to develop innovative biodegradable and compostable polymer formulations that will reduce the environmental impact of plastic packaging.\\r\r\n\\r\r\nWhile these materials have existed for some time, there are very few that offer long-term stability and even fewer that comply with the strict credentials for pharma and healthcare use.\\r\r\n\\r\r\nOur strategy tracks the annual percentage recycling rate and availability of post-consumer recycled materials (PCR) and matches this in our recommended recycled content composition. \\r\r\n\\r\r\nFor example, we offer glass bottles that are manufactured with 30% recycled glass, as well as plastic containers that are made with 30% or 100% recycled materials.\\r\r\n\\r\r\nRecycling is a key element of the circular economy, and Origin strives to conserve natural resources as much as possible. \\uD83C\\uDF0E\\r\r\n\\r\r\nRead more about our commitment to sustainability: link in comments.\\r\r\n\\r\r\n#GlobalRecyclingDay #Recycling #Sustainability #PCR\r\nWe were delighted to deliver a 'Vision for Social and Affordable Housing' fringe session in partnership with Chartered Institute of Housing - Northern Ireland at the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland Conference on Satutday 2nd March in Belfast.\r\nThe session was expertly chaired by Kellie Armstrong with an expert panel consisting of;\r\nHazel Bell OBE - NIFHA Chair\r\nCarol McTaggart - CIHNI Chair & Clanmil Housing Group \r\nMark Graham - NIFHA vice-chair & Co-Ownership  \r\nThe audience, including many councillors with an interest in Housing, regeneration and planning, heard the panel discuss the great work delivered by Housing Associations and the barriers to delivery such as funding, planning, legislation and labour.\r\nThe session concluded with an engaged Q&A session and was a great way to inform delegates on what our sector is delivering as well as discussing how much more we can deliver with the right government interventions and support.\r\n#socialhousing #politicalengagement\r\nGreat day in Leeds with the team today!

We like a good mix of different sized projects and its a great way for our staff to learn all aspects of the job.a€\u009d\r\n\r\nIt has also been a successful year for McLaren Construction with central and local government customers, with McLaren now having a place on 21 public sector frameworks.\r\n\r\nMore than A£200m of additional revenue is in the pipeline from the health, education, building safety recladding and refurbishment work, in addition to public sector developments with the greatest proportion coming from local authorities, the Department for Education and the NHS.\r\n\r\nGroup employees rose by 140 to 900 in 2022/2023, and during 2023 McLaren also relocated its head office to a state-of-the-art building at Canary Wharf, delivering a meaningful saving in head office rental costs.\r\nEmbracing Diversity and Culture: Celebrating Lunar New Year At Churchill \\uD83D\\uDC09\\uD83C\\uDFEE\r\n\r\nFrom its origins to its vibrant presence in popular culture, we're exploring the meaning behind this prosperous celebration with insights from our esteemed People Advisor Chloe Tsang\\uD83D\\uDC47\r\n\r\nhttps://bit.ly/3wh8KL7 \r\n\r\n#ChurchillSupportServices #Security #ChineseNewYear #LunarNewYear #Diversity #Inclusion #PeopleFirst\r\nExcellente premiA¨re journA©e  COSMETICA ALGERIA EXHIBITION \r\n\r\nL'A©quipe CPL Aromas  est trA¨s heureuse d'accueillir  nos clients et visiteurs algA©riens pour prA©senter nos derniA¨res crA©ations. \r\n\r\nEcoboost, notre technologie de parfums concentrA©s, a sucitA© un rA©el  intA©rAªt. \r\n\r\nVenez nous rendre visite au stand AC69!\r\n\r\nWe've had a great day at The Conveyancing Association's Annual Conference, delving into digital solutions transforming the #conveyancing landscape \\uD83D\\uDC49 https://lnkd.in/eD-ecENM\r\n\r\n#conveyancinginnovation #digitaltransformation #property #legal #housingmarket #conveyancers #newsletter #legaltech\r\nGreat conversation this morning at the isla Venue Roundtable. \r\nWe discussed accountability for both venues and event organisers as well as standards in measurement and reporting. \r\nWith sustainability becoming ever more prominent on our clients and our own agendas - we need to continue to work collaboratively across all stakeholders to drive sustainable events forwards. \\uD83D\\uDC9A\r\n\r\nThanks BMA House for hosting \\uD83D\\uDE4F\r\nArchitect and Partner Liz Sparrow leads our Science and Research sector. Her project work proves that a successful Life Science campus master plan needs a multidiscipline approach right from the start. \r\n\r\nHerea€™s three key reasons why:\r\nA \r\n1i¸\u008faƒ£ Clients need flexibility. Wea€™re planning 20-30 years ahead, so the right balance and range of disciplines with a free flow of ideas early in the process reveals many opportunities.\r\n2i¸\u008faƒ£ Future-proofing requires detail. To de-risk a project and achieve Net Zero emissions, we need to create layers within a master plan that take on board many aspects like building services and future climate change as well as the overall design.\r\n3i¸\u008faƒ£ It takes a lot of minds to create a community. Our experts fix non-technical, social areas upfront that provide the right environment for neurodiverse individuals. This campus a€˜hearta€™ must consider many inputs from acoustics to landscaping. \r\n\r\nRead a€˜Why master planning is more than just architecturea€™ here - https://lnkd.in/eM_d5_VQ\r\nA \r\n\\uD83D\\uDCC6 Liz will be at The Life Sciences and Innovation Real Estate Annual Conference on Wednesday 6 March. \r\n\r\nShe joins a panel to talk about: Shaping Environments: strategies for collaboration and campus excellence a€“ enhance your Life Science offering by strengthening cross collaboration.

Ita€™s been like a crash course on how to run and scale a business while and continuing to grow in the process. in addition, it was also a super freaking fun time filled with dancing, eating, drinking networking, and overall just good times.\r\nSerious about sustainability?

The process that JG Pears has developed treats and cleans the wastewater to allow it to be fed safely to the river. This water is tested weekly to ensure that all its release parameters are correct, ensuring no pollution of the waterways. We also purify the water further, using reverse osmosis (RO), so the water is then clean enough to be reused onsite. \r\n\r\nThrough this process, JG Pears are able to recycle almost all of our water as its used to provide water for the boilers and steam production. We also use the recycled water to wash and clean the factory and transport fleet and is used in our biofilter irrigation system, helping to abate odour emissions. \r\n\r\nBy investing in sustainable wastewater treatment technologies, we can ensure a cleaner, healthier future for all. \\uD83C\\uDF0D  \r\n\r\n#WorldWaterDay #Savingwater #Environment #JGPears\r\nWe start the week with the launch of our recruitment drive, opening up our new Apprenticeship Scheme 2024 and graduate scheme placements for applications from across the UK.\r\n\r\nAs part of the 2024 intake of apprentices and graduates, there are eight graduates (four in engineering and four in commercial) and eight apprentices (six wind turbine technicians, one for facilities management and another for environment and conservation with Dorenell Rangers).\r\n\r\nThese will be based at several locations, and you should start to see our publicity ramping up about the schemes over the coming days and weeks.\r\n\r\nThe deadline for applications to our graduate schemes is 29 January and 15 February for our apprenticeships.\r\n\r\nFind all applications at https://lnkd.in/eTKJQYqn\r\n\r\nPlease encourage your networks to apply for these opportunities by sharing our social posts and spreading the word.\r\n\r\n#WorkInRenewables #RenewableEnergy #RenewablesJobs #GraduateJobs #Apprenticeships #Sustainability\r\nWe're thrilled to announce that our Aldi Eco Concept Store project in Leamington Spa has been crowned Large Scale Project of the Year at the West Midlands Energy Efficiency Awards!\r\n\r\nThis pioneering initiative features a 209kWp solar PV system with 709 panels, projected to generate 167,409kWh annually.

The Delivery of the new Tigerbite Mini-Crusher will allow for the opportunity to educate students at Weymouth College on sustainability and the importance of reducing our carbon footprint.  \r\nThe Tigerbite Mini-Crusher, with its cutting-edge technology, turns old brick and concrete into reusable materials, reducing the strain on landfills and promoting a circular economy. By showcasing this innovative solution at Weymouth College, we aim to inspire learners to embrace sustainable practices and make a positive impact on the planet.\r\nStudents will be able to witness first-hand the power of the Tigerbite Mini-Crusher to pulverize brick and concrete waste, transforming it into gravel-sized particles that can be reused within various other construction projects. This not only reduces the demand for raw materials but also minimizes the carbon emissions associated with traditional construction practices.\r\nThe demonstration I received upon delivery was unbelievable, I had no idea that our construction waste could be recycled so efficiently. The Tigerbite Mini-Crusher, along with the training courses our students will receive centered around the machine, will make them think about more sustainable choices within their future careers as a builders. I truly believe that the next generation of builders will benefit greatly from this knowledge and will be more conscious of their impact on the environment. The added benefit is that the Construction department will no longer have to pay to have waste removed from the college, it will now be crushed and donated to areas locally where hardcore is required. I have to give a big thankyou to Darren French for all of the advice given!\r\nA \r\n#MiniCrusher #ConcreteCrusher #LandscapingTools #Builders #Renovators #tigerbite425 #tigerbiteminicrusher #Efficiency #sustainability\r\nWas a pleasure having you on site helping us use sustainable materials as and where we can to contribute to helping the environment.\r\n\r\n#groundworks #construction #constructionindustry #sustainability #sustainablematerials #environmentallyfriendly \r\n\r\nCale Phillips\r\nHave you missed our webinar on #Sustainability in #QualityImprovement?\r\n\r\nThe recording is now available on our website: https://lnkd.in/e9VKMfhf\r\n\r\n#Sustainable #SustainableHealthcare #Healthcare #ClimateChange\r\nUnique innovation - the only....\r\n\r\nWatch this space, launching soon - 20/02/2024\r\n\r\n#Construction #Project #Contractors #Architects #FireSafety #Contracting #Cladding #FaA§ade #Facades #CurtainWall #FacadeDesign #BuildingEnvelope #Membrane #PassiveFireProtection #FacadeEngineering #SealingSolutions #TechnicalAssistance #OnSiteSupport #OnSiteTraining #NetZero #NetZeroCarbon #Sustainability #ClimateAction #OBEX #CORTEX\r\nCongratulations to #OurImperial Communications Division, which has been awarded Blueprint Ally status fromA BlueprintedA for its work to improve equality, diversity and inclusion in all areas of its work and operations. \\uD83D\\uDC99A \r\nA \r\nThe Division is the first in-house team to receive the mark, which has previously only been awarded to agencies.A  \r\n\r\nHayley Dunning, Science Communications Lead and member of the Communications Division's EDI Working Group, said: \r\n\r\n\\\r\nDid you catch the announcement about our new website \\uD83D\\uDD17 ?\r\n\r\nWe're thrilled to announce the launch of IbisVision's new website filled with all you need to know about us and our remote solution, IBISengage.

It was a great session, here are some key points we discussed:\r\n\r\n - The energy transition is the investment opportunity of a lifetime, but one that will only be financed and delivered if returns meet expectations\r\n\r\n - The climate transition opportunity a€œuniversea€\u009d is enormous and complex, with multiple sectors, technologies, business models offering an array of opportunities but driving investment returns requires focus and discipline, with a deep understanding of sectors, risks and rewards, and with value creation strategies that play to an investora€™s strengths\r\n\r\n - The energy transition opportunity is further amplified by digitalisation, with AI in particular driving the need for more power, especially in Asia\r\n\r\n - Gas still has an essential part to play in the transition journey, as do transmission assets - there can be no transition without transmission\r\n\r\n - Emerging sectors such as green hydrogen, battery storage and district cooling offer opportunity in specific circumstances, which is why, again, investment discipline remains key\r\n\r\n - Two thirds of the capital invested in the power sector goes to the US and Europe and only one third for the rest of the world a€“ but it is precisely outside of developed, western markets that the demand for power is highest and this where the opportunities lie. Where do you want to be? With two-thirds of the capital chasing one-third of the opportunities? Or with the one-third of the capital that is chasing two-thirds of the opportunities?\r\n\r\nAll in all, from the conversations I continue to have, although there are still challenges in the market therea€™s plenty to be optimistic about. The growth markets Actis invests in are driving the global economy forward and delivering the strongest risk-adjusted returns. The climate and energy transition opportunity Actis invests in is vast and attractive to LPs. There are also signs pointing to GP consolidation gathering pace, which further underscores our decision to combine with General Atlantic. Lots to be excited about.\r\n\r\n#sustainableinfrastructure #energytransition\r\n\\uD83C\\uDF0D This International Women's Day, the theme is 'Invest in Women'. We want to shine a light on the pivotal role women play in driving a just green transition, especially in the realms of tech, data, and sustainability for business.\r\n \r\nWomen remain underrepresented in tech, with a gender pay gap of 16%. Low pay is also a major barrier to net zero for businesses in the UK, and women in the sustainability sector are disproportionately affected despite making up the majority of the workforce. \r\n \r\nIt's crucial to prioritise fair pay and recognise the immense value women bring to these fields. Investing in women is key to accelerating a green transition and creating a more sustainable future for all \\uD83C\\uDF31\r\n \r\n\\uD83C\\uDF1F Here at Sustainit, we're proud to have a majority women leadership team, and we actively support women in their career development from the ground up. \r\n\r\nWe know there's change to be made in our organisation and beyond.

If you are applying for planning permission for a development, local planning authorities across the UK will require you to demonstrate how your development will achieve a 10% net gain in biodiversity. Many local authorities have already adopted this policy (or a higher requirement).\r\nA Biodiversity Impact Assessment is concerned with comparing the condition and size of habitats on a site before and after the completion of development; ita€™s how we predict whether or not your site will meet a 10% net gain in biodiversity once the development is concluded.\r\nTo do this, a site must be surveyed before any site preparation works have begun so that a baseline figure for biodiversity can be calculated.\r\nOur team of experts will support you from inception through to submission, completing site surveys, reporting, and digital mapping, as well as being able to complete the Biodiversity Net Gain calculator, advise on optimal landscaping and design layouts, and also hold dialogue with the Local Planning Authority where it would be of benefit for a submission.\r\nTo find out more, visit \\uD83D\\uDD17 https://bit.ly/42z38Ic and get in touch.\r\n#biodiversity #biodiversitynetgain #ecology\r\nCirium's parent company RELX has featured the talents and interests of some of our creative colleagues across the business to celebrate Black artistry.

After working with Somner Macdonald on two previous renovation projects, a London family asked the practice to return to help them reimagine the rear of their house for the next generation. a\u0081 \r\na\u0081 \r\nIn response, the team designed a new extension that connects seamlessly with the main body of the house and flows through to the garden, giving the family a unique kitchen and dining space. a\u0081 \r\na\u0081 \r\nBoth client and architect were familiar with Russwood flooring, having used it in their previous projects. In this instance, Somner Macdonald specified our Pearl shade of European oak flooring in Prime grade, to complement the simple, calming and assured spaces created by their design. a\u0081 \r\na\u0081 \r\nSomner Macdonald and their client were particularly drawn to our oak flooring by its attractive colouring, figuring and durability. We use European oak in our solid and engineered boards because it is considered to be the finest in the world. Wire brushes are used to pull out the softer spring wood and expose the harder summer wood, leaving a beautifully textured and durable surface.a\u0081 \r\na\u0081 \r\nPhotography: Chris Snooka\u0081 \r\na\u0081 \r\nTo read the full case study, featured in our Profile magazine, click the link below.\r\n\r\nhttps://lnkd.in/euTsci_d\r\n\r\nA full-funnel creative case study - LeMieux\r\n\r\nIn 2023 LeMieux carved out an aggressive international growth strategy, including the US.\r\n\r\nThis strategy required leveraging paid social to adopt a full-funnel performance strategy.

Cybersecurity\r\n\r\nCFOs need to work closely with IT and other stakeholders to ensure that the company's financial and other data is secure.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Talent Management\r\n\r\nCFOs need to develop and implement effective talent management strategies to attract and retain the best employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.

The session was hosted in WEFa€™s Ice Village where fellow panelists Bob Maughon of SABIC, Rich Powell of ClearPath, Matthias Tauber of Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Gokhan Eyigun of SabancA± Ventures and our own Andrea Brown Smatlan covered the following: \r\n\\uD83C\\uDF0D The World Economic Forum's report underscores the need for a fresh perspective in achieving net-zero for the chemical industry amid the identified risks climate change and economic volatility. With 96% of all goods connected to chemistry, the industry plays a pivotal role in meeting global climate goals, making a different approach imperative.\r\n\\uD83C\\uDF31 To ensure greater sustainability, a careful rebalancing of policy and business is essential. Embracing existing and emerging technologies, like hydrogen as a fuel source, requires government support in funding, infrastructure development, and creating a robust global framework. Additionally, increasing investment in resilient electricity grids is crucial to support the industry's uninterrupted operations during the energy transition.\r\n\\uD83E\\uDD1D Recognizing that climate challenges extend beyond individual companies, collaboration is key. Two levers for trust and collaboration include aligning on measurement through standardized climate target methodologies and addressing common challenges by participating in industry groups like the World Economic Forum and Global Impact Coalition. Collaborating internally and externally will propel the industry from context to action. Whata€™s next? More meetings on how we can drive value and create solutions for everyday sustainable living. \r\n\r\n#Sustainability #NetZero #Collaboration #WEF24\r\nWe believe that institutional investors should understand the risks and opportunities inherent in biodiversity loss and embrace natural-based solutions as a critical component of their climate agenda.

The campaign aims to encourage young people to reconnect with nature over a cup of coffee, hoping it will impact rising rates of anxiety and poor mental health.\r\n\r\nThe Slow Brew experience created by Lisa Aoyama and Catarina Neves will be hijacking peoplea€™s coffee breaks, discouraging them from endless doomscrolling. \r\n\r\nFWD:Coffeea€™s menus will offer customers the option of The Slow Brew. Once selected, the coffee drinker will have access to a toolkit containing a map and some kaleidoscopic magnifying lenses they can use to interact with nature. With the final destination kept secret, The Slow Brew will eventually lead the coffee drinker to a moss bed in a garden, where they will be encouraged to slow down and appreciate nature.\r\n\r\nThe campaign is part of an initiative from purpose-driven non-profits, The Glimpse Collective and Purpose Disruptors who founded the Agency for Nature to help turn the tide on our growing disconnect from nature. \r\n\r\nThe Slow Brew experience will be available on 6th February at FWD:Coffee on Curtain Road from 11am - 4pm. \r\n\r\n#creativity | #design | #community | #content | #brandexperience | #experiencedesign | #experientialmarketing\r\n#GeniuseeReviews  The partnership between Attention ExchangeA® and Geniusee goes beyond a mere business arrangement.

Recommendations include adopting technologies like heat recovery systems and exhaust treatments.\r\n\r\nPromoting sustainability in refits involves educating and collaborating with various stakeholders, including shipyards, yacht management, and suppliers.\r\n\r\nThe younger generation of owners is expected to drive change by prioritising environmental impact reduction and influencing industry decisions.\r\n\r\nShipyards play a vital role in fostering sustainability by improving their practices and promoting sustainable initiatives during refits.\r\n\r\nCollaboration with forward-thinking shipyards can facilitate sustainability improvements at the planning stage of refit projects.\r\n\r\nDespite some uncertainty surrounding YETI scoring and implementation, the workshop underscores the importance of education and dialogue in driving sustainability efforts in the superyacht industry.\r\n\r\nClick here to read more > https://bit.ly/4ctAzQG \r\n\r\n#yeti #shipyards #yachting #sustainability\r\nWe have a great opportunity for those in and around South Kirkby to join our team as Assistant Accountant \\uD83D\\uDE4C\r\n\r\nAs part of our Finance team, you'll support our Financial Controller and Management Accountant in tasks such as...\r\n\r\naœ… Assisting in month-end production of management accounts\r\naœ… Ensuring maintenance of accurate and timely accounting records\r\naœ… Maintaining professional relationships both internally and externally\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\\uD83D\\uDCCD Excellent IT skills (Particularly in Microsoft Excel)\r\n\\uD83D\\uDCCD High level numeracy skills\r\n\\uD83D\\uDCCD Experience within a similar position\r\n\\uD83D\\uDCCD AAT Qualified preferred\r\n\\uD83D\\uDCCD Previous experience of Sage, Chess, Mandata systems is advantageous\r\n\r\nWhat we offer:\r\na­\u0090i¸\u008f Flexible working hours\r\na­\u0090i¸\u008f Immediate start available\r\na­\u0090i¸\u008f Permanent contract.\r\n\r\nApply with your CV here az¡i¸\u008f emma.moxon@icecostorelogs.co.uk\r\nLISTEN: The latest episode of EGa€™s School of Hard Knocks has dropped and for our fourth lesson Ia€™m joined by Canary Wharf Groupa€™s Jane Hollinshead \r\n\r\nIn this episode Jane shares vital advice around the power of diversity of skills, the value of your network and finding balance.\r\n\r\nAnd Hollinshead isna€™t afraid of hard knocks, not only in the boxing ring, where she keeps herself fit and grounded, but in life.

A Answer = RPO (Recruitment Process Outsourcing)\r\n\r\nCompanies leverage RPO to find, screen, assess, and onboard top-tier talent. Peregrine RPO transforms the traditional model by bringing you on-demand access to a stream of inclusively recruited, screened, and assessed talent tailored to your requirements.\r\nDo changes in candidate demand leave your HR team exhausted and frustrated? We can partner with you to manage those volume upswings and when the peak is past, we can step back until the next time you need us. \r\nWorking with us gives HR teams / functions breathing room to focus on strategic priorities. Even better, it accelerates hiring, reduces cost-per-hire, and secures hard-to-land talent that might slip through the cracks of overloaded recruitment teams. We can improve the candidate experience by speeding up hiring processes, increasing engagement, and reducing drop-out rates.\r\nAt Peregrine, wea€™re redefining RPO:\r\n\\uD83C\\uDF1FMastery of the latest tech a€“ Our team leverages leading-edge automation and AI to pinpoint ideal candidates faster. \r\n\\uD83C\\uDF1F Access to best-in-class assessors a€“ We have 450 assessors who adhere to accessibility best practices and ensure every candidate has an inclusive experience. \r\n\\uD83C\\uDF1FHands-on account management - You never feel your concerns are ignored.

One opportunity is the demand for bamboo in the Construction sector and the possibilites here are varied and exciting. In this context, Sundar Bharadwaj and Vicky A. Mitchell visited the Coventry University to meet with David Trujillo, theA Assistant Professor at the School of Energy, Construction and Environment.A David and team have been studying the characteristics of Bamboo varieties from across the world for a number of years and they are of the opinion that bamboo-based solutions provide sustainableA alternatives to solve some of the sector-specific challenges related to energy consumption and carbon emissions. TERRAGRN plans to collaborate with David and the Coventry University to understand these opportunities specifically in the African context, and assess the social, climate/ carbon, and commercial benefits of using bamboo for housing and other simple structures.A  \r\n\r\n#CoventryUniversity #Professor #SchoolofEnergy #Construction #Environment #CivilEngineering #Biomass #Bamboo  #EnergyConsumption #BioBasedSolutions, #AgroForest #regeneratingtogether #Africa #SouthAfrica #sustainability #carbonemissions #sustainablealternatives #bamboovarietals #bamboosolutions Atelier One\r\nThe Health and Wellbeing event at the Stoke Head Office has been an inspiring and uplifting experience.

Historically, many wetlands in the UK have been drained for agriculture or experience problems from polluted agricultural runoff leading to the loss of these crucial habitats. It has never been more important to protect them.\r\n\r\nLast year, we embarked on a rewetting project as part of our wider nature recovery vision and in nearly 6 months, ita€™s been incredible to watch nature take the driving seat and witness positive changes! Native plants and wildlife are making a comeback, water quality is improving, and our wetland is proving to be a natural buffer against some of the recent extreme weather.\r\n\r\nIta€™s important to remember a wetland like ours isn't just about nature; it's about people too! Wetlands provide recreational spaces, support local livelihoods, and offer educational opportunities. We're actively involving the community in this journey, creating a shared sense of responsibility for our environment.\r\n\r\nWant to rewatch our rewetting journey, check out our YT channel: https://lnkd.in/eEruEbYk\r\n\r\n#WetlandA #RewettingA #WaterA #GreenHealthA #NatureA #EcosystemA #BiodiversityA #SpeciesA\r\nSafe Havens support adults experiencing a mental health crisis out of hours, 365 days a year.

You are the beating heart of connection, a haven of possibilities. Among the many, one holds a special place in my heart, The Dovetail. This 80 sq .m square space has transformed through the chapters of its rather short lifespan, a testament to its resilience and adaptability.\r\n\r\nOnce a solemn police station, it emerged anew as a vibrant community space nestled in the heart of the Carpenters Estate. Born out of conversations with residents amid the challenges of the COVID era, the Dovetail became more than a mere physical space, it became a symbol of unity and understanding.\r\n\r\nWhile serving as a focal point for the Carpenters' regeneration, the Dovetail transcends its role. It acts as a Switzerland, a neutral ground where frustrations find a voice, and tensions find solace. Within its walls, countless challenging conversations have brewed, navigating the complexities that accompany change.\r\n\r\nFrom being a canvas for black history art exhibitions to a stage for flamenco and Zumba dance, the Dovetail embraces a myriad of expressions. It has witnessed the brushstrokes of abstract art and the rhythmic beats of serial performances. The space has been a backdrop for celebrations, from A kings' coronations to festive Christmas gatherings and delightful bring-and-share events. The aroma of shared meals lingers, echoing the laughter and camaraderie that define its essence.\r\n\r\nMore recently, the Dovetail has transformed into a bustling community kitchen, where young and eager hands chop, stir, and create delicious meals. It also opens its doors to local entrepreneurs, fostering the growth of the next generation of businesses.\r\n\r\nThis 80 sq m square space is a multifaceted gem, a testament to its ability to evolve and meet the diverse needs of its community. It serves as a reminder that more spaces like these are essential in every community, weaving the key threads in our complex, challenging, and sometimes chaotic society.\r\n\r\nOn this Valentine's Day, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all community spaces, for being the anchors that ground us, the stages where our stories unfold, and the catalysts for positive change.\r\nWith love\r\n\r\n#communityspaces #communitydevelopment #communitywealth #valentinesday\r\nJoin us at FTTH Conference in Berlin, 19-21 March, as we showcase our world-class products in Optical Fibre, Optical Fibre Cable, and Connectivity solutions, all poised to shape the future of Europe's digital networks. \r\n\r\nDon't miss out a€“ see you at FTTH Europe Conference 2024!\r\n\r\n\r\nRahul PuriA ||A David De CraemerA ||A Sam LeemanA ||A Ivy CharanA ||A Phillip CoppinA ||A John DaviesA ||A Luca FacchinettiA ||A David WillemsA ||A Matteo VillaniA ||A Silke ReuterA ||A Fulvia BortolottoA ||A Lorenzo Egido SA¡izA ||A Leonardo PaceA ||A Himanshu GauravA ||A Rohit G.\r\n#ftthA #stlA #berlin\r\nAfter The Brightsides' incredible 52-day row across the Atlantic Ocean to Antigua, charitable donations are still rolling in!\r\n\r\nThe team has raised over A£140,000 for The Get A-Head Charitable Trust and Meningitis Now, with their achievement continuing to inspire.\r\n\r\nWea€™ve been proud to sponsor their epic journey and support the crew in raising these vital funds a€“ and you can still donate below if you havena€™t already!   \r\n\r\nhttps://lnkd.in/ezG2AhDK \r\n\r\n#thebrightsides #atlanticocean #getahead #meningitisnow The Brightsides Atlantic Row\r\nThe Rise Women's Health Support Group is kicking off this Friday at 12pm GMT - don't forget to sign up if you'd like to join: https://lnkd.in/eNTEe5tM\r\n\r\nKindly led by Lesley Johnson, BBC Studios' Global Director, Home Entertainment, and a seasoned advocate for the health-related needs of women in a workplace, the group will offer support to women in their working lives going through issues relating to menopause, pregnancy, fertility treatments, endometriosis and more, as well as educating and encouraging employers to implement best practices to support their female employees.\r\n\r\n#womenshealth #femalehealth #womeninbroadcast #genderequality\r\nWe did it!

MaYEA aims to address unemployment by enabling over 1 million young individuals, with 80% being women, to access wages and self-employment in the apiculture industry through skill development and financial support.\r\n\r\na€œHoneybees play multifunctional roles beyond the production of honey, beeswax, and other hive products, and deliver vital insect pollination services to food and industrial crops, forages, forest trees, and other plant biodiversity, a€œ says Zerihun Lemma Damenu, IIRR Ethiopia Country Director. a€œThe MaYEA project uses integrated beekeeping as an entry point to sustainably improve our rural communities by generating dignified jobs and contributing to the regeneration of the natural environment.a€\u009d\r\n\r\nThe overarching objective of the 5-year program is to triple current annual honey production by 2028, achieved through the recruitment of 300,000 new beekeepers, increased productivity among 350,000 existing young beekeeping farmers, and the engagement of an additional 350,000 young individuals in integrated value chain activities.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the potential of the Ethiopian apiculture sector to generate up to four million employment opportunities, MaYEA addresses existing challenges to economic opportunities, including skill gaps, low production volume and quality, limited value addition, inadequate market infrastructure, and weak regulatory frameworks. To address these issues, the program adopts a multi-faceted transformative approach encompassing improved beekeeping technologies, digital advancements, capacity building, and access to finance and markets.\r\n\r\nThis initiative holds promise to increase honey and beeswax production and improve quality, promote market-driven value addition, enhance integration with complementary value chains, and foster an enabling environment for youth and apiculture sector development. \r\n\r\nAlongside our implementing partners, we embark on this journey with a commitment to fostering economic sustainability, youth empowerment, and poverty alleviation for young people across Ethiopia.\r\n\r\n#MaYEA #Apiculture #YouthEmpowerment\r\nA£13.5 million for 48 engineering biology R&D projects\r\n\r\nNew projects will use engineering biology to tackle challenges in the fields of health, environment, food production and sustainability.\r\n\r\nRead more here >\r\nJoanne Fowler and James Sowray had a great time at the annual apprenticeships conference last week, MH&A's first conference of the year! \\uD83D\\uDCAB \r\nA \r\nOne of the things that kept coming up in conversation was the challenge posed by functional skills to apprenticeship completions.

It also identifies the gaps that need to be addressed to aid farmers' climate resilience. Phylis showed examples of how regenerative practices, like mulching and agroforestry, are implemented in the African context for small-scale farmers.\r\n\r\nLeaving this event, it was more clear than ever that regenerative agriculture interventions must center farmers in order to maximize their benefits and to understand why farmers may resist adopting better practices. Addressing the key challenges farmers face and providing incentives will serve as powerful motivators, which, in turn, will improve productivity and incomes.\r\n\r\n\\uD83D\\uDCF8 Check out some captured moments of this impactful event below!\r\n\r\n#RainforestAlliance #Sustainability #SustainabilityDay #CoffeeSector #BetterBeans #AfricanFineCoffeesConference #AfricanCoffeeWeek #AFCA2024 #CoffeeScorecard #AFCA\r\n\\uD835\\uDDE5\\uD835\\uDDF2\\uD835\\uDDF1\\uD835\\uDE02\\uD835\\uDDF0\\uD835\\uDDF6\\uD835\\uDDFB\\uD835\\uDDF4 \\uD835\\uDDD8\\uD835\\uDDFA\\uD835\\uDDF6\\uD835\\uDE00\\uD835\\uDE00\\uD835\\uDDF6\\uD835\\uDDFC\\uD835\\uDDFB\\uD835\\uDE00 \\uD835\\uDDE2\\uD835\\uDDFB\\uD835\\uDDF2 \\uD835\\uDDE9\\uD835\\uDDEE\\uD835\\uDDFB \\uD835\\uDDEE\\uD835\\uDE01 \\uD835\\uDDEE \\uD835\\uDDE7\\uD835\\uDDF6\\uD835\\uDDFA\\uD835\\uDDF2\r\nA \r\nTGS Automotive Group has over 30 yearsa€™ experience helping UK public sector fleets convert panel vans into efficient, sustainable mobile workspaces.\r\nA \r\nOur van conversions offer multiple sustainability benefits including:\r\nA \r\naz¡i¸\u008f Lightweight interior build reduces vehicle weight, directly lowering fuel use and CO2 emissions\r\naz¡i¸\u008f Electric vans see extended range from these weight reductions, enabling daily routes to be completed with fewer charging stops\r\naz¡i¸\u008f Custom storage solutions maximise payload capacity, further optimising fuel efficiency\r\naz¡i¸\u008f Extending usable lifespan of new and aging vans already in service reduces need for replacement\r\nA \r\nAs the shift toward low-carbon transportation accelerates, every fleet must find ways to reduce their environmental impact.\r\nA \r\nPartner with us to create van conversions that balance:\r\nas™i¸\u008f functionality\r\n\\uD83D\\uDCE6 storageA \r\na™»i¸\u008f sustainability\r\nA \r\nRethink what your fleet is capable of - schedule a no-obligation consultation with one of our advisors today.\r\nA \r\nCall 0117 965 9965 or send us an email atA quotations@tgs-group.com\r\n\r\n#publicsector #fleet #procurement #storpro\r\nOur mission...\r\n\r\nIs to make sure that your business is as secure as it can be.\r\n\r\nDon't leave it too late!\r\n\r\nContact us now.\\uD83D\\uDC47\r\n\\uD83D\\uDCDE0800 038 5500\r\n\\uD83D\\uDCE7info@newtons.co.uk\r\n\r\n#newtonsolicitors #settlementagreements #legalclarity #fairnessmatters #youradvocateinlaw #legalinnovators #clientfirst #sustainabilityinlaw #legalsolutions #legalexperts #solicitors #legal #law #lawyersofinstagram #legalnews #harrogate #knaresborough #york #leeds\r\nWe're so excited to share this fantastic testimonial from Albion Water!\r\n\r\nThe customer required a replacement Siemens MAG sensor body.

For 2024, their plans include training more Mental Health First Aid Responders and introducing workshops to build confidence and better recognise early signs of burnout.\r\n\r\na€¢ Diversity and Inclusion (D&I): With insights from a diversity and inclusion survey, the group collaborated with an external consultant to foster safe spaces for LGBTQIA+ and neurodiverse communities.

Purpose-driven. \r\n\r\nThese are the characteristics of the 362,000 green jobs we will need to fill by 2035.\r\n\r\nOur data suggests that 61% of people under the age of 35 are looking for work that actively tackles the climate crisis. Thanks to them, we have more than green thumbs, we have a green generationa€¦ one that will make net zero possible.\r\n\r\nAt this weeka€™s International Energy Week Conference, I joined Beverley Gower-Jones OBE FEI, Hannah Mary Goodlad and Peter Tipler, to discuss the role of green jobs in powering up the energy transition.\r\n\r\nAt OVO, we are doing everything we can to create and fill these positions, but alone we only make a small dent in what we need to achieve as a country. \r\n\r\nAlongside my fellow panelists, we discussed the need to:A  \r\n\r\naœ… Embed green skills into education, providing early career support\r\naœ… Implement widespread industry and government support, assisting in job creation and training\r\naœ… Provide a sense of belonging and connection at work, building workplaces that people want to be part of\r\n\r\nThe roadmap has been drafted. Now ita€™s up to everyone to make it happen.\r\nDigital Health Scientist Katherine Young, PhD explains how CBT and psychological therapies are empowering young people to take control of their mental health and break negative emotion cycles.\r\n\r\nWatch this clip from our #CBTalks podcast for more!\r\n\r\n#ChildrensMentalHealthWeek #DigitalMentalHealthSolutions #CognitiveBehavioralHealth\r\nToday the Financial Times has published the UKa€™s Leading Management Consultants 2024 report.

Many of our team love to start their day with a workout. Whether ita€™s a run or a dog walk, a tennis match or a round of golf, a hot yoga sesh or a ride on the Peloton, ita€™s a great way to kick things off.\r\n\r\n\\uD83D\\uDC36 Time with our pets. Quite a few of us have a four-legged friend or two. Therea€™s nothing better (especially in the winter) than finding a cosy place to sit and having a furry companion curled up beside you, keeping you company while you work. Plus, working from home means we get more time for games, walkies, and extra cuddles.\r\n\r\n\\uD83E\\uDD57 A delicious lunch. Wea€™re a team of foodies at Flexa, and working from home with flexible hours means we can enjoy a proper lunch break. Some of us like to cook, others prefer to pop out to their favourite eatery - either way, we always share photos and recipes in Slack!\r\n\r\n\\uD83D\\uDCBB The perfect set-up. The great thing about working from home is not having to sit in the same spot all day long. We all have a work station at home, but sometimes, ita€™s nice to mix it up. For example, in the summer, many of us enjoy working in the garden, and on those icy mornings, ita€™s nice to be able to work from bed.\r\n\r\n\\uD83C\\uDFB2 Social time. Being remote-first, we make a conscious effort to ensure wea€™re all getting time to chat and have fun together. Our random channel in Slack is a constant stream of memes, TikToks, funny stories, and hot debates - such as whether or not aliens built the pyramids. We also have a team call once a week, where we chat and play interactive games together.\r\n\r\na˜•i¸\u008f Regular breaks. Throughout the day, ita€™s important to step away from your laptop every once in a while. Being at home means therea€™s less pressure to stay sat at our desks, and breaks can be used to get some fresh air, put a wash on, take the dog for a walk, or sit and chill with a cuppa.\r\n\r\nWhat does your perfect work from home day include?

The site will provide opportunities for allowing nature to flourish a€“ a rewilding approach that will increase biodiversity.\r\n\r\nGurpreet Gujral, Managing Director at Atrato Group says: a€œWe are thrilled to see this landmark agreement between Atrato Onsite Energy and Britvic now in action, reducing carbon emissions while delivering attractively priced energy. Atrato Onsite Energy is all about designing unique solutions for clients tailored to their energy consumption needs and real estate site constraints.

Cat was speaking about their partnerships with credit unions and the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, enabling much needed finance to flow to growth stage social enterprises in GM. \r\n\r\nEnabling credit unions to lend the savings of local people to social enterprises in their community opens up an exciting new pool of capital. At Access we are pleased to be helping to underwrite this along with the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation, enabling GMCVO and the credit unions to offer the products the sector needs while protecting depositors money. \r\n\r\nThe discussion at yesterday's event touched on many of the nuances of how the partnership was built and how it is being managed. Balancing the needs of different investors and partners is one of the critical skills in making blended finance work - and the GMCVO team demonstrate this in spades. The overt ambition of GMCVO to want to remove themselves from the picture when the credit unions have built enough experience of lending to social enterprises is also a compelling example of an organisation focused on changing the system it is part of, rather than prioritising its own existence.\r\n\r\nThe Community of Practice (aka Blended Finance Geek Club) is gaining momentum and Ia€™m looking forward to our next two day conference in April where we will bring together around 100 practitioners from across the worlds of impact investing and development finance to explore how blended finance structures are part of a systems change toolbox.\r\nWea€™re proud to announce Synack, Inc. as a Premium Interactive Workshop Sponsor for #CYBERUK24.\r\n \r\nLearn more about their expertise and sponsorship of this yeara€™s conference. \r\n\r\nDona€™t miss out - get your ticket now!\r\nwww.cyberuk.uk/\r\n\\uD83D\\uDC4B We've had a number of conversations with customers regarding the upcoming Climate Week and COP29 events being held this year.

His commitment to growth and excellence sets a stellar example for aspiring professionals everywhere.\r\n\r\nWhy did you choose an apprenticeship?\r\nIt allowed me to learn and develop my insurance knowledge while being able to apply that knowledge in my role as a Commercial Insurance Advisor.\r\n\r\nHow has the apprenticeship helped you academically and practically?\r\nI have gained a fantastic qualification while working. It has given me the tools to balance work and studying.\r\n\r\nWhat made the apprenticeship a natural fit for you?\r\nI was able to study and learn while working. Having worked since I was 17 and not go uni.\r\n\r\nHow has the apprenticeship influenced your career path?\r\nTo show me the paths available and fine tune what I want to achieve in the next 5-10 years.\r\n\r\nIn what ways has the apprenticeship expanded your options beyond traditional trades?A \r\nMy apprenticeship has exposed me to a diverse range of roles and opportunities within the commercial insurance sector. This has not only expanded my skill set but also opened doors to various career paths and advancement possibilities that I may not have considered otherwise.\r\n\r\nHow has your team supported you during the apprenticeship?\r\nHave been amazing support and still supporting. Guiding me through work and balancing that with the studies .\r\n\r\nWhat differences do you find between academic learning and hands-on experience in your apprenticeship?\r\nIts good to have those study days and getting that theory aspect in, however being a kinaesthetic learner I have learnt most of the apprenticeship while working in my role and wished I was able to work 5 days.\r\n\r\nWhat do you consider the pros of an apprenticeship?\r\nIt is a fantastic option for young eager, learners that is a perfect option for university and college and I am a huge supporter of apprenticeships and should be allowed within the education curriculum.\r\n\r\nHow do you balance working and studying in your apprenticeship?\r\nThe structured lessons, tutorials and knowing which days I was studying in advanced allowed me to plan ahead and not loose track.\r\n\r\nWhat advice would you give to someone considering an apprenticeship or similar path?\r\nIf youa€™re aged between 18-24 this is the perfect opportunity to take up. My advice is take your time, speak up and ask for help and most importantly make sure you are organised like no one else.\r\n\r\n#NAW2024 #Apprenticeships\r\n\\uD83C\\uDF27 Research shows poor employee health is estimated to cost the UK economy A£138 billion per year. \r\n\r\n\\uD83D\\uDCC5 And the majority of lost working hours aren't due to formal absence - they're down to presenteeism. On average, UK employees take 6 sick leave days per year, but actually lose an additional 43 days due to overlooking their physical and mental ill health. \r\n\r\n\\uD83D\\uDD0E What's more, this is particularly profound in employees under 30. Whilst younger employees report to have better physical health, they have significantly higher levels of mental health concerns including burnout, depression and fatigue. \r\n\r\n\\uD83C\\uDF31 In 2024 businesses must make proactive strides to close the widening gap between what teams need and the support currently provided.

And how long does it take to get the grant money if successful? \r\n\r\nJust a few questions, Granted Director Jon Williams covered at the recent Innovation Funding and Support Conference in Birmingham. \r\n\r\nJon took to the stage with a panel of speakers to present on one of our favourite topics 'Navigating innovation funding'. \r\n\r\nJon spoke on the following key points: \r\n\r\nR&D tax credits vs R&D grants: \r\n- Notably, R&D tax credits are retrospective as opposed to gaining funding in advance with R&D grants.\r\n\r\nCapital grants vs R&D grants: \r\n- Capital grants are for capital expenditure, typically to stimulate employment and are most often distributed regionally. While R&D grants are for NEW and UNIQUE R&D projects with wider impacts and are typically distributed nationally. \r\n\r\nHow long does it take to get the grant money? \r\n- As a guide, it typically takes between 9-12 months from application to first drawdown of grant funds. Grant funds are typically paid in arrears. \r\n\r\nThe importance of fund matching\r\n- The key to accessing the right grant fund at the right time lies in being a€œgrant-readya€\u009d through early anticipation of likely funds and their strategic fit to your R&D priorities. Matching your project to the optimum funding opportunity radically enhances your chances of funding success and the return on your investment.\r\n\r\nIn need of R&D  grant support? Or looking for guidance on the innovation funding landscape?

Here are some key legal trends to keep an eye on in 2024: \r\n\r\n1i¸\u008faƒ£ Tech-Driven Legal Practice: Embracing innovative technologies such as AI, blockchain, and legal analytics is no longer an option but a necessity. The intersection of law and technology is reshaping how legal professionals approach research, document review, and even dispute resolution.\r\n\r\n2i¸\u008faƒ£ Data Privacy & Cybersecurity: With the ever-increasing reliance on digital platforms, safeguarding sensitive information is paramount. The legal community is witnessing a surge in regulations and compliance measures to protect data privacy, making cybersecurity a top priority for businesses and legal practitioners alike.\r\n\r\n3i¸\u008faƒ£ Remote Legal Work: The global shift towards remote work is influencing the legal profession. From virtual court hearings to online document collaboration, the industry is adapting to a new era of flexibility. As we navigate these changes, effective communication and secure digital practices become essential.\r\n\r\n4i¸\u008faƒ£ Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Compliance: Stakeholders are placing a growing emphasis on corporate responsibility. Legal professionals are expected to play a pivotal role in ensuring companies meet ESG standards, addressing issues such as sustainability, diversity, and ethical business practices.\r\n\r\n5i¸\u008faƒ£ Legal Operations Optimization: Efficiency is the name of the game. Legal departments are increasingly adopting tools and methodologies to streamline processes, cut costs, and deliver better outcomes. Project management principles are becoming integral to legal operations.\r\nThe legal field is dynamic, and staying ahead requires a commitment to continuous learning and adaptation. \r\n\r\nWhat other trends do you foresee shaping the legal landscape in 2024? \r\n\r\nLet's engage in a conversation and explore the future of law together. \r\n\r\n#LegalTrends #Law2024 #InnovationInLaw #LegalTech #ESG\r\n\\uD83C\\uDF3F Join Triple Solar and Evergen Solar  at the Low Carbon Agriculture Show \\uD83C\\uDF1E\r\n\r\n\\uD83D\\uDCC5 Mark your calendars for March 6th and 7th as wea€™re thrilled to participate in the Low Carbon Event alongside Triple Solar! \\uD83D\\uDE9C\\uD83C\\uDF31\r\n\r\na„¹i¸\u008f Discover sustainable solutions firsthand and learn how to reduce carbon footprint while saving costs.

Diversions around the Cape of Good Hope began in December as the Houthi Movement fired on Israeli-bound, US and British connected vessels and Alphaliner reports that the rush to fulfil exports before Chinese New Year, these week long celebrations begin tomorrow. All ships larger than 12,500 TEUs are now deployed a€œfollowing the reactivation of two ultra-large container ships to service over the past fortnight,a€\u009d reported Alphaliner.\r\n\r\nAfter its latest survey completed on 29 January. Idled capacity has reached a 19-month low, at 89 ships of 226,051 TEUs, and the idled figure may have fallen even further in the last week with the latest figure from Linerlytica showing just 78 non-operational ships totaling 125,425 TEUs, 0.4% of the fleet. a€œCarriers are starting to redesign their networks to incorporate the diversion via Africa, together with the expected skipped sailings in the slack period after Chinese New Year and the arrival of many large new buildings, this situation of tight tonnage supply might change in the coming months,a€\u009d said Alphaliner.\r\n\r\nA fact that Linerlytica can confirm with its latest report signaling a further 43 ships delivered in the last 30 days, totaling 303,601 TEUs. The combined statistics also reveal an expected surge of capacity on the Asia to Europe trades of 23.3%, when compared to last yeara€™s deployment, reaching an all-time high of 6.44 million TEUs. This rush to deploy capacity is entirely a result of the diversion from the Suez to the Cape route since December 2023. a€œOver 700,000 TEUs of additional capacity has been added to the trade in the last two months alone. 55% of the additional capacity has been absorbed in the Far East-Mediterranean trades where transit times have increased by 10 days to the West Med and 18 days to the East Med while transit times to North Europe has increased by seven days on average,a€\u009d said Linerlyticaa€™s analysis.\r\n\r\nSource:Container News \r\n\r\nWe believe in an inclusive energyA transition to a net-zero future.A EmbeddingA human rights, creatingA working environments where ourA people can thrive, and havingA aA positive impact in the communitiesA where we operateA guide our actionsA to promote social progress.a€‹\r\na€‹\r\nLearn more about ourA initiativesA around theA world: https://lnkd.in/eEqc-Ueh\r\n\r\n#energytransitiona€‹ #technology #sustainability\r\n\\uD83C\\uDF1FDid you know that 75% of all the aluminium ever produced is still in productive use? a™»i¸\u008f This statistic from the International Aluminium Institute highlights the importance of sustainability in the industry and showcases the durability and recyclability of this versatile metal.

In a recent project, we provided a package to heat an anaerobic digester, reinforcing our commitment to environmentally conscious practices.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the solution: A 300kW boiler and a\r\n2,500-litre fuel tank. Our team strategically deployed this powerful\r\ncombination, precisely tailored to meet the unique requirements of the\r\nanaerobic digester. The 300kW boiler ensures efficient heat generation, optimising the digester's performance and aligning with broader sustainable energy initiatives.\r\n\r\nPutting Sustainable Practices into Action. The anaerobic digester\r\nplays a pivotal role in converting organic waste into valuable biogas, and\r\nmaintaining optimal conditions is essential. Our installation not only\r\naddresses heating needs but also seamlessly aligns with the eco-friendly ethos of anaerobic digestion processes.\r\n\r\nDriving the Circular Economy. By meeting the heating\r\nrequirements of the anaerobic digester, we actively contribute to the circular\r\neconomy, turning waste into a valuable resource.\r\n\r\nSpeak with our team for more information: 0808 169 1919, enquiries@crossrental.co.uk\r\n\r\n#Sustainability #GreenEnergy #AnaerobicDigester #BoilerInstallation\r\n\\uD83D\\uDC24 \\uD835\\uDC04\\uD835\\uDC1A\\uD835\\uDC2B\\uD835\\uDC25\\uD835\\uDC32 \\uD835\\uDC01\\uD835\\uDC22\\uD835\\uDC2B\\uD835\\uDC1D \\uD835\\uDC11\\uD835\\uDC1E\\uD835\\uDC20\\uD835\\uDC22\\uD835\\uDC2C\\uD835\\uDC2D\\uD835\\uDC2B\\uD835\\uDC1A\\uD835\\uDC2D\\uD835\\uDC22\\uD835\\uDC28\\uD835\\uDC27 \\uD835\\uDC22\\uD835\\uDC2C \\uD835\\uDC0D\\uD835\\uDC28\\uD835\\uDC30 \\uD835\\uDC0E\\uD835\\uDC29\\uD835\\uDC1E\\uD835\\uDC27 \\uD835\\uDC1F\\uD835\\uDC28\\uD835\\uDC2B \\uD835\\uDC0D\\uD835\\uDC1E\\uD835\\uDC31\\uD835\\uDC2D\\uD835\\uDC06\\uD835\\uDC1E\\uD835\\uDC27 \\uD835\\uDC0E\\uD835\\uDC26\\uD835\\uDC22\\uD835\\uDC1C\\uD835\\uDC2C \\uD835\\uDFD0\\uD835\\uDFCE\\uD835\\uDFD0\\uD835\\uDFD2! \\uD83D\\uDC24\r\n\r\nNextGen Omics 2024 is here for NextGen Omics enthusiasts!

My recent move to Singapore has meant that Ia€™m increasingly working with clients within the #palmoil sector, so it was enlightening to hear from influential industry figures, academics, and economists on the industry's prospective challenges and opportunities in the year ahead.\r\n\r\nHere are some of my key insights from the conference:\r\nA \r\nEU's Deforestation Regulation & Smallholder InclusionA \\uD83E\\uDDD1a€\u008d\\uD83C\\uDF3E\\uD83C\\uDF34 \r\nThe dialogue around the EU's Deforestation Regulation, particularly viewed through a non-Western lens, was eye-opening. The discourse focused on the gap between policy intentions and on-the-ground realities. A poignant issue that continued to be raised was whether smallholders could effectively adapt to the #EUDR directives in time without jeopardising their place in global supply chains. For me, the conversation underscored the necessity of globally inclusive policy-making that incorporates stakeholders at every supply chain level. \r\nA \r\nComparison with Other Agri-commoditiesA \\uD83C\\uDF31 \r\nConversation noted that palm oil's #sustainability advancements are commendable, especially compared to commodities like cocoa, soy, and rubber. The sector has made significant progress in certification and\r\ndeforestation reduction, presenting a valuable opportunity for cross-sector\r\nknowledge exchange to enhance sustainability practices industry-wide.\r\nA \r\nDigitalisation and AutomationA \\uD83E\\uDD16 \r\nThe surge of #digitalisation and #automation themes indicated a strong belief in the transformative power of technology. Investments in this area have the potential to reverse declining yields and inject resilience into production operations.\r\nA \r\nSustainability as a Growth Factor\\uD83C\\uDF43 \r\nDespite the price-focused nature of the conference, sustainability emerged as a core discussion point. It was intriguing to observe it characterised as both an industry hurdle and a catalyst for inclusive growth and market expansion.\r\nA \r\nBiofuels and Market DynamicsA aœˆ \r\nIn-depth sessions on biofuels highlighted the palm oil sector's ambition to serve as a feedstock for the aviation industry despite current restrictions in EU and US markets. The conversation advocated for greater regional market utilisation and stressed the palm industry's need to be a more proactive participant in shaping #biofuel policies. Additionally, advocacy for recognising Asia Pacific's sustainable advancements was seen as essential to dismantling current barriers.\r\nA \r\nPalm Oil Supply OutlookA \\uD83D\\uDCC9 \r\nA forecast that surprised me was the anticipated slowdown in palm oil supply.

We think it will look a lot like 4 Hardman Square, our iconic office in Spinningfields, Manchester, which we are currently repositioning to reflect the ways in which people want to work post-pandemic. \r\n\r\nOn completion, expected by the end of this year, the building will offer best in class Grade-A space that combines contemporary design with environmental responsibility. All 55,000 sq ft of space will be upgraded, with a new mezzanine reception and ground level external faA§ade that will include real plants to promote local biodiversity. Responding to the strong occupier demand for flexible, well-amenitised offices, the project will deliver a range of amenities including a wellness studio and boxing gym, a business lounge, and changing facilities. \r\n\r\nIn line with Orchard Streeta€™s responsible investment approach, the sustainability credentials of the building will also be transformed through the installation of new utilities, all electric air conditioning to improve air flow and ventilation, and PV solar panels, all of which will decarbonise the building by removing reliance on gas consumption. The office will also utilise a smart building management system to optimise energy use for improved efficiency, comfort, and sustainability, with the upgrade also focused on improving building connectivity. Targeting BREEAM Excellent, NABERS 4-stars and an EPC rating of A, the project has set ambitious energy use intensity and embodied carbon targets.

Learn more about a workplace that embraces #diversity and #inclusion. #LifeAtArgo\r\nIt's been 7 days since #Greenbiz24. Here are our team's 7 key insights and calls to action to drive positive change:\r\n\r\n1. Enhance communication skills to influence change \r\nAmidst the climate crisis, we face a narrative and leadership challenge. Effective communication and stakeholder engagement are crucial for addressing these issues. Bridging the knowledge gap is essential to inspire action. Thought starter: Enhance financial literacy for sustainability professionals and provide sustainability training for finance professionals.\r\n\r\n2. Prioritize transparency and accountability in ESG efforts \r\nThe ESG backlash movement underscores the critical need for transparency as a cornerstone amidst heightened scrutiny and stakeholder expectations. Navigating the ESG landscape requires openness and accountability, particularly when ambitious targets are not (fully) achieved. Addressing areas of shortfall fosters dialogue and drives progress, effectively countering both greenwashing and greenhushing. \r\n\r\n3. Stay proactive in navigating regulatory changes\r\nWhile aspirations often outpace implementation, policy could be the game-changer. Regulations are increasingly recognized as pivotal for achieving our sustainability goals. Successfully navigating this landscape demands a proactive stance, staying updated on evolving mandates, and embracing compliance to drive positive impact. \r\n\r\n4. Embrace tech to streamline efforts\r\nTechnology is revolutionizing sustainability reporting, presenting both challenges and opportunities. Adoption is crucial for process improvement, data accuracy, and informed decisions. AI, in particular, holds promise for enhancing efficiency, time savings, and promoting sustainable practices across sectors amidst increasing digital maturity and data availability.\r\n\r\n5. Harness the power of supplier engagement\r\nData challenges, particularly in Scope 3 emissions discussions, are ubiquitous. It's imperative for all organizations to persist in requesting suppliers' data, even amid initial challenges. Implementing shared goals and incentives via innovative financing mechanisms - carrots and sticks - could help drive progress. \r\n\r\n6. Join momentum around nature & biodiversity\r\nNature's complexities present challenges in measurement, especially in assessing systemic effects, ecosystem stability, and financial implications. A significant data gap exists with only approx. 7% currently accounted for.\r\nRegulations highlight the importance of measuring external impacts, providing an opportunity to harness momentum from greenhouse gas efforts for nature conservation and restoration.\r\n\r\n7. Embrace collaboration\r\nComplex challenges underscore an opportunity for stakeholders to embrace a pre-competitive mindset. The emphasis on collaboration signals a shift toward industry-wide cooperation, leveraging diverse expertise and resources to tackle shared sustainability goals collectively. \r\n\r\nGet in touch to transform these insights into impactful actions for your team!\r\nToday, some of our foundation students met with Serena from The Forge Project in Scunthorpe to make a large donation of clothes to their charity.\r\n\r\nThe Forge Project work tirelessly to offer food, clothes, mental health advice and support to homeless and roofless people in our community.\r\n\r\nWe are really pleased that our Fashion Share enrichment has been able to support the Forge Project, and we hope to be able to provide further donations in the future!\r\n\r\n#ThisIsThePlace #Donations #Charity #CommunitySupport\r\nCollateral management is a data driven process, crossing multiple areas within firms and types of products. Using the CDMSa€™s standardised data for collateral representation, firms can streamline operational processes that result in improved counterparty risk management and collateral optimisation.\r\n\r\nHear from Vernon Alden-Smith (ISDA), Justin Hasnat (FIA Tech), Lionel Smith-Gordon (REGnosys) & Malwina Wasowska-Azemi (CloudMargin) on the work the ISDA CDM-Collateral working group members have contributed to the advancement, growth and development of the CDM and demonstrate the benefits that their firm or clients will realize.

Whilst the rule explicitly mandates sustainability claims to be clear, fair, and not misleading in relation to a product or service, firm-level claims or commitments may also be a source of contention. \r\n\r\nThe FCA has aimed to expand on the vague nature of the rule by proposing additional guidance for firms. The expectations for sustainability claims are laid out as follows - they must be:\r\n - Correct and capable of being substantiated\r\n#NOME?\r\n#NOME?\r\n#NOME?\r\n\r\nRegarding the third element, the Guidance document reminds firms that #CMA (Competition and Markets Authority) & #ASA (Advertisement Standards Authority) guidance, the FCA Principles 6 & 7, and the Consumer Duty apply to sustainability claims made at entity-level. It adds that a firm's claims about themselves may be considered part of a 'representative picture' in a decision-making process. \r\n\r\nGiven that net zero targets are easier to set than implement, firms should be aware of this interpretation and have some form of action planned to back this commitment. Worst case scenario, this would help you get your homework done early ahead of planned FCA requirements for Transition Plan Taskforce (#TPT) aligned disclosures. \r\n\r\nLet me know what your views are in the comments!\r\n\r\n#netzero #transitionplans\r\nEmbracing sustainability isn't just good for the planet a€“ it's a smart move for businesses too \\uD83C\\uDF0D\r\n\r\n\\uD83D\\uDCB7 Cost Savings: Recycling cuts waste disposal costs, putting more pounds back into your business.\r\n\r\naœ… Positive Brand Image: Showcasing your commitment to the environment boosts your brand's reputation.\r\n\r\nas–i¸\u008f Legal Compliance: Stay on the right side of the law by adhering to environmental regulations.

Lucas Schoeppner noted there are still more questions than answers around transition planning, but that Wespath encourages asset managers to think in terms of systemic risk rather than looking at companies one by one. Caroline Escott said she would expect any asset manager thinking effectively about managing climate change to be thinking about engagement with policy-makers and that stewardship reports can be useful in highlighting any disconnect between practice and stated priorities. \r\n\r\nIn response to how they approach allocating stewardship impact to activities, Caroline suggested this has to be taken a€œwith a pinch of salta€\u009d as while it was possible to say impact had happened following certain activity, it was rare that could be shown as decisive. Lucas echoed this, describing it as a€œa foola€™s erranda€\u009d to tie impact entirely to stewardship engagements and chair Tom Attwooll agreed this was an issue of correlation rather than causation. Caroline and Carol Nolan Drake highlighted the recent launch of the ICGN Viewpoint on reflecting climate-related matters in financial statements as a useful resource for asset owners and asset managers: https://lnkd.in/ddr_WG-5\r\n\r\nWe hope attendees found this a useful session and will explore the resources highlighted a€“ thanks to our speakers for their time and expertise.\r\n\r\n#stewardship #sustainability #mandates #sustainabilityreporting #assetowners #assetmanagers\r\nTo finish off the events surroundingA #scottishapprenticeshipweekA , our 1st year Carpentry/joinery apprentices were visited by Donna Shillinglaw, a representative of the Mental health charityA Megan's SpaceA The session was based on copingA mechanismsA for all triggers of Mental Health,A recognizingA the signs within yourself and others.A Reducing the stigma around Mental health andA learningA how to communicate.A #itsgoodtotalk.\r\nA \r\nWe believe thatA integratingA mental health training into the apprenticeship programs provides important skills and knowledge to understand and support mental health and well-being, also helps create a more supportive and inclusiveA workplaceA environment, where all resources are available.A \r\nA \r\nThe session was really informative and the apprentices engaged really well.\r\n\r\nThank you DonnaA Megan's Space\r\nEveryone is talking about AI.

Property owners can proactively prevent errors by integrating smart solutions and ensuring their BMS installations run efficiently. Moreover, upgrading smart technology can reduce carbon emissions, lower expenses, and improve employee well-being. \\uD83D\\uDCA1\r\n\r\nBut here's the key: When it's time to modernise your BMS, a holistic transformation isn't always the answer.

It involves creating or enhancing habitats as part of development projects to deliver measurable improvements for biodiversity. BNG is becoming a regulatory requirement under the Environment Act, mandating at least a 10% increase in biodiversity value for most developments in England from 12 February 2024. This initiative underscores a commitment to environmental sustainability and the enhancement of biodiversity in the face of ongoing habitat loss and declining wildlife populations.\\uD83C\\uDF0F\r\n\r\n\\uD83D\\uDD0D Gentiana€™s expertise in biodiversity assessments, including habitat mapping, is pivotal in comprehensively understanding and managing ecological landscapes. \r\n\r\n\\uD83D\\uDCD1 Aligning with BNG requirements is essential, as it involves a detailed evaluation of a site's existing biodiversity value. Gentiana€™s capabilities in habitat mapping and AI-driven analysis can significantly aid businesses in achieving their Biodiversity Net Gain objectives, ensuring both regulatory compliance and a positive contribution to environmental sustainability.\r\n\r\naœ… Adhering to regulatory standards is crucial in safeguarding biodiversity. Gentian's precise habitat mapping services ensure that organisations not only meet but exceed biodiversity and environmental requirements in their development projects.\r\n\r\n\\uD83D\\uDC4C The positive impact your business can have on biodiversity is significant. Through Gentian's habitat mapping services, companies can effectively identify, preserve, and enhance valuable habitats and ecosystems. Our advanced AI-driven habitat mapping provides a deeper understanding of ecosystems, facilitating compliance with Biodiversity Net Gain requirements and fostering a proactive role in environmental stewardship.

At P&M we want to ensure our interventions reflect the views and concerns of our people. Our recent Sustainability Survey gave everyone an opportunity to have a voice and help shape how P&M seeks to balance the needs of people, profit and planet.\r\nA \r\nThe survey sought feedback on a range of issues, including the impacts of #climate #change respondents were most concerned about. It also asked about solutions to the climate crisis. High scoring answers were using greener and alternative energy, changing lifestyle (reducing consumption) and better resource management.\r\nA \r\nP&M is determined to play our part in combatting the #climate emergency and #biodiversity loss. As part of that journey, we will ensure that the sentiments of staff help drive our positive interventions. \r\nA \r\nFor instance, respondents voiced particular concerns about a€œdeteriorating ocean environmentsa€\u009d and highlighted the need for a€œmore education on what everyone can do to help the situation.a€\u009d In response we will continue to support charities that help protect aquatic ecosystems and plan to deliver sustainability training across the workforce. \r\nA \r\nRead more about the survey here: https://lnkd.in/e8Xw4q4i\r\nHere it is!!
